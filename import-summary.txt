ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* .idea/
* .idea/AXMLEditor.iml
* .idea/codeStyles/
* .idea/codeStyles/Project.xml
* .idea/encodings.xml
* .idea/misc.xml
* .idea/modules.xml
* .idea/vcs.xml
* .idea/workspace.xml
* AXMLEditor.jar
* AndroidManifest.xml
* README.md
* xmltest/
* xmltest/AndroidManifest.xml
* xmltest/insert.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* libs/kxml2-2.3.0.jar => app/libs/kxml2-2.3.0.jar
* libs/xmlpull_1_1_3_4c.jar => app/libs/xmlpull_1_1_3_4c.jar
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/cn/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/cn/.DS_Store
* src/cn/wjdiankong/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/cn/wjdiankong/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
